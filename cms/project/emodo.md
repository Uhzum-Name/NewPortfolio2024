Over recent years, digital advertising has shifted from generic ads to highly targeted, personalized experiences. However, the loss of cookies and device IDs poses challenges for advertisers and publishers. Emodo, an AdTech company, sought to leverage advanced technologies like AI and machine learning to deliver dynamic, immersive creative solutions. As part of their rebrand by 20nine Agency, I was brought in as the digital art director to redesign Emodo's website.

Leading a team of creative directors, strategists, designers, and copywriters, I oversaw the complete overhaul of Emodo’s website. We implemented a user-centric design system, ensuring a seamless user interface and experience that aligned with Emodo’s innovative brand. The new design showcased Emodo’s cutting-edge technologies, including their AI-driven Advanced Native solution, which enhances contextual relevance, creative personalization, and KPI optimization.

The primary challenge was to effectively communicate Emodo’s sophisticated technology in an engaging and accessible manner. We addressed this by integrating interactive elements and visually appealing designs that highlighted Emodo’s expertise and innovative solutions. Additionally, we ensured the website could cater to both B2B audiences and potential new consumers, bridging the gap between technical prowess and user engagement.

The redesigned website successfully connected Emodo with existing and new partners, while showcasing their industry-leading technology and fresh brand identity. The result was a digital platform that not only enhanced Emodo’s market presence but also demonstrated their commitment to advancing digital advertising.
