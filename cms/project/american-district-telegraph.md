ADT, a leader in smart home security, sought to modernize and humanize their brand. The goal was to shift their identity from a home security provider to a comprehensive human protection platform, appealing to both traditional and younger audiences.

  
We conducted extensive market research to understand evolving customer expectations. This informed our design choices, emphasizing innovation and emotional connection. Iterative design phases included stakeholder feedback to ensure the new branding resonated across diverse demographics.

A key challenge was balancing ADT's traditional image with the new, modern identity. We addressed this by integrating familiar elements with fresh, innovative visuals and messaging. This approach successfully positioned ADT as a forward-thinking leader while maintaining trust with long-time customers.
