I led the digital redesign for Orion Wealthtech, a pioneering wealth management technology firm. The goal was to create a modern, user-friendly website that reflected their innovative approach and established a strong digital identity.

To kick off the project, I conducted thorough research to understand Orion Wealthtech’s brand values, target audience, and industry landscape. Using this information, I developed a cohesive design system that ensured the user interface was both visually appealing and highly functional. This design system included guidelines for typography, color schemes, icons, and interactive elements, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience across the website.

A significant challenge was to clearly and effectively communicate the sophistication of Orion Wealthtech’s services in an engaging manner. To address this, I implemented a clean, modern design with intuitive navigation and interactive elements that showcased their technology. Regular feedback sessions with stakeholders ensured the design aligned perfectly with their brand vision and user expectations.
